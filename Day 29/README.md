📅 Day 29 – Mini Project: Real-Time Currency Converter

🗒️ Project Overview  
Built a fully functional real-time Currency Converter app using Python.  
It uses an interactive GUI, live exchange rates via API, and clean code principles.

🎯 Features
- Convert between 50+ major currencies
- Real-time exchange rates using exchangerate-api.com
- Dark mode GUI built with `tkinter` and `ttk`
- Handles invalid input and API errors gracefully

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- tkinter (GUI)
- requests (API calls)
- File I/O for loading currency list

💡 Topics Applied
- Functions and error handling (`try-except`)
- File reading (`currencies.txt`)
- API requests with `requests`
- GUI development using `tkinter`
- Styling with `ttk`
- Clean modular code organization

💻 Solution
- `main.py`: GUI and event handling  
- `converter.py`: Handles API interaction and loads currencies  
- `currencies.txt`: Static file with 50+ currency codes
