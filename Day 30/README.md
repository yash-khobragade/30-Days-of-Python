## 📅 Day 30 - 🚗⚡ Electric Car Sales Analytics — Interactive Dashboard

Welcome to my **Capstone Project** for **Day 30** of the `#30DaysOfPython` Challenge by Indian Data Club!  
This project brings together **real-world data analytics**, **interactive dashboards**, and **clean Python code** using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze **global electric car adoption trends** through an interactive, filterable web dashboard.  
Using a **real-world dataset**, I showcase how EVs:
- Are transforming global vehicle sales,
- Reduce oil consumption,
- Increase electricity demand,
- And shift the share of EVs in the automotive market.

## 🌍 **Key Features**

✅ **Multiple Dashboards:**  
- **Global EV Sales Over Years:** Track how sales have grown from 2010 onward.  
- **Regional EV Sales Trends:** Compare adoption trends by country/region.  
- **Electricity Demand:** Visualize the rising energy needs of EVs.  
- **Oil Displacement:** See how EVs reduce oil dependency over time.  
- **EV Stock Share:** Analyze how the share of EVs has increased in total vehicle stock.

✅ **Fully Interactive:**  
- Built with `Plotly` for dynamic charts.
- Filter data by **region**, **powertrain**, and **year range**.
- Tabs make it easy to navigate between dashboards.

✅ **Reusable and Scalable:**  
- Anyone can expand it to add new parameters, charts, or live API feeds.
- Can be deployed easily using Streamlit Cloud.
