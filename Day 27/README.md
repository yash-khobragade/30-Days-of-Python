📅 Day 27 – Using SQLAlchemy ORM with FastAPI & SQLite

🗒️ Topics Covered  
🔹 ORM (Object Relational Mapper) – Mapping Python classes to database tables  
🔹 SQLAlchemy – Powerful ORM tool for Python  
🔹 CRUD Operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete in DB  
🔹 SQLite – Lightweight embedded SQL database  
🔹 FastAPI Integration – Connect endpoints with database models

🎯 Challenge  
🔧 Enhance the Book Management REST API from Day 26 by integrating:
- SQLAlchemy ORM for managing the database layer  
- SQLite as the database backend  

The app now stores and retrieves book data persistently via the database instead of in-memory.
